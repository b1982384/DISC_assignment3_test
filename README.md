# DISC Application - Home Page Design

## Description

This is a test repository for my **DISC (Northwestern Technical Consulting)** application. It contains basic HTML and CSS that I created based on my **Figma design** for the **home page** of a social networking application.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to translate design ideas into functional front-end code using HTML and CSS. This serves as the starting point for developing the overall application.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page according to the Figma design.
